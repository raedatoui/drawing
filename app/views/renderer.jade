    h5 Thank you!

    h5 In case you haven't noticed, this app does a few extra things
    ul
      li user input validation: ensure parameters are integers, color is hex, and commands are correct
      li can't execute an L, R or B comand until a C is executed first
      li check if coordinates don't exceed canvas dimensions
      li added actual coloring to the filling cells and some animation to see the algorithm in action
      li allow clearing the board by execute a new C command and creating a new canvas
      li the app can take an array of commands and auto execute the program. use the button to see that in action
      li tests are located in the test directory. Launch test/index.html in your browser. The unit tests are based on
      a(href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine") Jasmine.
      |  The test suite is only concerned with the renderer and verifies the state of the canvas. the same commands are used in the specs. Please checkout the source on github to make sense of the unit tests and and how the behavior is verified
